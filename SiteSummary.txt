I made a web site for people without twitter to spectate Melee tournaments!


This project started as to get some practice in web development and learn a few things that we didn't cover at my university. In the last month it got pretty usable to I decided to share it with others. 
I wanted an easier way to watch streams and follow discussions on twitter since twitch chat is too hard to follow and offers no useful discussion past a certain number of viewers.


Let me be the first to say that I am not a designer, so it's not the prettiest site you'll ever see, but it gets the job done. It definitely has some kinks I'll be ironing out as I have the time but they should be minor.


This past week was the final week I was able to work on it before I start my job search, so I decided to polish it up and let people here give it a try for Redbull Gods and Gatekeepers this weekend.
I've been using it for the last few months, since mid June(ish), and rarely find myself on twitch itself anymore.


It's set up to support other games in the future but I wanted to start with Melee because it's my favorite and I wanted to give back to the community (since Smash has one of the best communities in eSports)
Also I also don't know who to add to the twitter lists for the other games at the moment.


If I missed anyone's twitter who you believe should be added to the list [here](https://twitter.com/ContentHomepage/lists/melee) let me know and I can add them.

If you find any problems or think it's missing something let me know!

**TL:DR** Twitter, Twitch Stream, and Twitch Chat on one page, with a twitter list made by me so you don't have to deal with it.
